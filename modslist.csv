# To add a new Steam Workshop mod:
# Put a Steam Workshop ID and exact name on Steam Workshop seperated by a comma (whitespace ignored) all on a single line.
# If you want to add another mod do it on another line.
# Steam Workshop IDs can be found at the end of the Steam URL of the workshop item: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2950280649.
# Note: the '#' character makes it so that the character and any character after it, on the same line, is ignored when the file is parsed.
# Example:
# 2950280649, DayZ-Rat # Remove the first '#' character on this line and you have a valid line for adding a workshop item.
